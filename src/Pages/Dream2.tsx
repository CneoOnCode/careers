            Programming dreams

          <p>
            My dream for programming is to become a senior software engineer at
            Microsoft.
          </p>
          <h1>
            My Brother
            <hr></hr>

          <br></br>
          <p>
            He is a microsoft software engineer that works in vancouver and it
            is littearly my dream to become like him.
          </p>
          <h1>
            Some stats
            <hr></hr>
          </h1>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            For your context in 2022 26 million users are named themselves
            software developers.
          </p>
          <h1>
            What does it take to achieve it?
            <hr></hr>
          </h1>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            The easiest way to achieve is by making yourself known on the
            interent and have a talent. Just like creating this website, whats
            unique? Because most hiring companies actually look at your talent
            instead of actual education.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <h1>
            What if you achieved this dream
            <hr></hr>
          </h1>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            If I achieve this dream not only would I make alot of money, but I
            basically dont do work and thus its a easy passive way of work as a
            software engineer. This would be a big step up both fincally and
            mentally as this job is like stress free.
