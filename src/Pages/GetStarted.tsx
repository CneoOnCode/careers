          <h1>Description of a Software engineer</h1>
          <hr></hr>
          <p>
            Software engineers focus on applying the principles of engineering
            to software development. Their role includes analyzing and modifying
            existing software as well as designing, constructing and testing
            end-user applications that meet user needs — all through software
            programming languages. All the online applications like Twitter,
            Instagram, Github, Youtube, etc are all made by software engineers.
            This means that they have to make design documentation, constantly
            adapt to new frameworks that the company uses, and constantly adapt
            to different problem scenarios.

            <img src={require("./../Images/stats.png")} />​<br></br> Ruby, Go,
            Rust, During the 1970s, programming made its mark as the first
            programming language C was made and used to program systems. That
            was the start of companies like Microsoft, Apple, Huawei, etc. This
            allowed programmers to code a basic UI (User interface) to display
            to computers. This means that this allowed them to make different OS
            (Operating Systems). Near the 2000s a new programming language named
            C++ was invented. This was mainly because C didn't have any classes
            not support object oriented programming. This was also the "Creation
            of Programming" started. With the early 2000s, Javascript, Java, C#,
            Typescript, Lua, Visual Basics, HTML, JSX, TSX, CSS, etc started to
            be released this allowed is the "Present Happiness" stage as all of
            these languages now can create any app from games for PSP to
            applications for space engineering all came from these languages.

              The debate of the century of wether you need math or not is
              dependant on what your doing. If you are doing competitive
              programming you would for sure need math to calculate the speed,
              performance, logic, and simplicity for the code. But if you are a
              front end engineering you would need to learn about graphics
              design and also some front end engineering experience. For back
              end/security part of the work. You would need to learn about logic
              and implementation without causing bugs which is hard for most
              junior software engineers. But many big tech companies would
              require you to have a bachlors degree at least. ​​

            <hr></hr>
            <p>
              You will need the basics of computer science like Object Oriented
              Programming, Big O Notation, Data structures and Algorithms. Other
              then that you would need to learn a programming language like C++,
              Java, C#, Javascript, and sometimes Python. Depending on the job.

            <p>
              Pay in this department is really high. For entry junior level
              software engineer(SWE) you would get a entry $90,000CAD -
              $190,000CAD. This is only ENTRY the more you work the more you
              would get higher. For entry level Senior software engineer you
              would get a entry $120,000CAD - upwards of $600,000CAD. That is
              only ENTRY same goes, if you work more you can get bonuses upwards
              of $10,000CAD - $100,000CAD.

              My brother is a SWE at Microsoft, and he is a self taught
              programmer. He recently got in to Microsoft as a software engineer
              and he decided to vlog his day in a life as a SWE at Microsoft
              Vancouver. This is a short one but it is the most accurate one yet
              in Vancouver.

            <hr></hr>
            <p>
              Well as my brother works as a self taught programmer. I was
              inspired to do some research. After some time I picked up my first
              language and it was C#. It taught me a lot of the basics of
              programming. But overtime like 2022 I learned about CS50 (Free
              Harvard Course) about Computer Science. There I learned about data
              structures and algorithms along with some Object Oriented
              Programming and Big O Notation. With those skills I can now make
              my code more cleaner and reuse-able. Since spigot code sometimes
              can really slow down production. I also visited my brother at work
              in Microsoft. And it is far more then just programming. You have
              to make sure that you use Github (File management system for
              developers) and make sure that the senior developers accept your
              pull request to officially make sure your done your work. This
              also came in handy as I used it to manage my own projects. All of
              that leaded up to the interest of making me a programmer.

            As you can see, the pay for these jobs are quite good. Despite there
            requirements they still do pay well over $100,000 sometimes. To
            further more let you understand. The market since 2006 has always
            been in demand for programmers. And as the demand increases money
            and requirements increases. The big difference about Senior software
            engineer and Junior is that senior just "looks" at your code and PR
            (Pull Request) to make sure everything is fine. While Junior is the
            big thing behind it doing all the work and writing design
            documentation.
