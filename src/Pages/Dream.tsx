            My dream is trying to go to the olympics by 2032 and represent team
            Canada for badminton at the age of 20.

          <p>
            Brian Yang represents team canada in almost every Pan asian
            tournement. He also played in the olympics which is a really rare
            chance. Not only this he also is really young at the age of 20
            years. So technically he is living my dream right now. A young
            athlete that already played in the olympics.

          <br></br>
          <p>
            Around 2.89 percent of the world plays badminton, and in each
            country there is only 5 that is chosen thus means in total there are
            only 0.289 percent of the world goes pro.
          </p>
          <h1>
            What does it take to achieve it?
            <hr></hr>
          </h1>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            To be honest, it really just takes time and dedication to achieve my
            dream because Badminton as a career is really hard already. But if
            your going pro, you not only need a good physique but also a fast
            brain and reaction speed. This all links up because Badminton is the
            fastest raquet sport.
          </p>

          <h1>
            What if you achieved this dream
            <hr></hr>
          </h1>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            If I achieve this dream not only I would be happy, my whole family
            and friends would probably too. Also if I do manage to go play in
            the olympics that would make me really really happy.
